            <h2>Types of Flows</h2>
            <p>Power Automate is a service that you can use to automate repetitive tasks to bring efficiency to any organization. </p>
	    <p>You can create cloud flows, desktop flows, or business process flows. </p>
	<h3>Cloud flows</h3> 

	<p>Create a cloud flow when you want your automation to be triggered either automatically, instantly, or via a schedule. </p>

	<h3>Desktop flows</h3> 

	<p>Use desktop flows to automate tasks on the Web or the desktop. </p>

	<h3>Business process flows </h3>

	<p>Business process flows provide a guide for people to get work done. They provide a streamlined user experience that leads people through the processes their 	organization has defined for interactions that need to be advanced to a conclusion of some kind. This user experience can be tailored so that people with 	different security roles can have an experience that best suits the work they do. </p>

            <h2>Sign Up</h2>
	<h2>Sign up and sign in for Power Automate </h2>
            <p>Starting with Power Automate, as an individual, is easy! Before you can create a cloud flow, sign up by using any email address. If you've never used an 	online Microsoft product with that address, you'll need to take a few moments to register it. </p>

	<h3>Sign up free </h3>

	<p>If you haven't used other online Microsoft products, you'll need to sign up. </p>

 <ul>
            <li>In Power Automate, select Try free in the upper-right corner. </li>

	<li>Enter your email address. </li>

	<li>Select the right arrow. </li>
</ul>
 

	<h3>Sign in</h3>

	<h3>Use paid features </h3>

	<p>Anyone can sign up and get a free plan for Power Automate. If your organization has purchased Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365, you may already have access to Power Automate. You can also start a 90 day free trial, or purchase a Power Automate license if you want to use the paid features. </p>

<p>For administration information, go to Flows in your organization Q&A. </p>

	<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

            <li>Start with a template, which is a prebuilt flow that's set up for you. </li>

		<li>Start from blank, if you already have a process in mind and can't find a template for it. </li>

	<p>Environments create boundaries between different types of work. For example, an organization might have separate environments for different departments. Many organizations use environments to separate flows that are still being developed from those that are ready for widespread use. You might have access to multiple environments or only one. If you have the appropriate permissions, you might even be able to create your own environments.</p>

	<p>To verify which environment you're in, find the environment switcher near the right side of the header.</p>

	<p>Environments where you have either system administrator and/or system customizer security role membership appear under Build flows. The Other environments list displays environments where you have read-only permissions, and can access approvals.</p>

<h4>Filter environments by role</h4>

<li>Make sure that you're in the correct environment before you create a flow, an app, or a similar component. You can't easily move components from one environment to another.
